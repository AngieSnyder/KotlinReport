<h1>Features of Kotlin</h1>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h5>Kotlin is open source</h5>
        First and foremost, Kotlin in an open source programming language. This statically typed language was built by
        Jetbrains, who are also makers of IntelliJ IDE. Apart from being an open source programming language, Kotlin
        doesn’t ask much when it comes to converting existing Java code, it happens with a single-click tool. But, if
        you wish to learn Kotlin from the scratch, there’s great and cost-effective beginner course available on Udemy.
    </li>

    <li>
        <h5>Full Java Interoperability</h5>
        One of the best features of Kotlin programming language is its deep interoperability with Java, which is bound
        to attract more Java developers to learn Kotlin. It runs on the JVM and uses Java libraries and tools. It
        offers backward compatibility for Java versions 6 and 7.
    </li>

    <li>
        <h5>Kotlin compiles to JVM bytecode or JS</h5>
        As Kotlin compiles to JVM bytecode or JavaScript, Java and JS developers will be most tempted to learn this
        programming language. Added to this, the programmers who use a garbage collected runtime will also find Kotlin
        programming language interesting.
    </li>

    <li>
        <h5>Data Classes in Kotlin</h5>
        The feature scope and necessity of a class is always argued by the programming language designers. A typical
        data class in Java has tons of boilerplate code one needs to skip while finding out the real use of that class.
        However, in Kotlin, you can write the equivalent of the same Java code in a very simple manner and save tons of
        typing and mental effort. It’s one of the best features of Kotin programming language.
    </li>

    <li>
        <h5>Defaulted parameters</h5>
        The defaulted parameters in Kotlin are pretty handy when you pass the arguments by name, instead of index.
        Their advantage is seen when there’s a function with tons of optional parameters.
    </li>

    <li>
        <h5>Kotlin imposes no runtime overhead</h5>
        The standard Kotlin library doesn’t have garbage, it’s tight and small. It has mostly focused extensions to the
        Java standard library. Many of its functions are inline-only that just become inline code. Kotlin has many
        optimizations which, specifically, help Android development.
    </li>

    <li>
        <h5>Null Safety in Kotlin</h5>
        Kotlin programming language’s type system aims at eliminating the perils of null references from code, which is
        often called The Billion Dollar Mistake. For example, in Java, accessing a member of null reference results in
        a null reference exception. Kotlin doesn’t compile code that assigns or returns a null. This is seen as one of
        the most important features of Kotlin.
    </li>

    <li>
        <h5>Extension functions</h5>
        Thanks to the extension functions in Kotlin, you can add methods to classes without making changes to their
        source code. Similar to Scala’s implicit methods, you can add methods on a per-user basis to classes. While
        extension functions are often controversial, every now and then it’s very useful.
    </li>

    <li>
        <h5>Swift is like Kotlin</h5>
        It’s a feature of Kotlin, but I came across this great link on Hacker News, so I’ll just leave it here to do
        all the talking: http://nilhcem.com/swift-is-like-kotlin/
    </li>

    <li>
        <h5>Kotlin wants you to write less code</h5>
        Unlike Java, which needs you to write everything, Kotlin compiler can understand from the code and write the
        remaining code, for example, it can infer types in variable declarations. This increases productivity and saves
        time.
    </li>
